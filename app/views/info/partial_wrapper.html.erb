<%# super hack. We have some partials in info, that we sometimes want 
    to render as 'top level', in teh application-level layout. This used to just
    plain work, but in rails 3.2.9 stopped wroking. Workaround is to make this
    lame full template, that does nothing but render the partial mentioned
    in the local argument, but now it can be wrapped in a layout. 
    
    from controller:
    
    render "partial_wrapper", :locals => {:partial => "some_partial_name"}, :layout => whatever
%>

<%= render partial %>
