the 'cronmail' script was written by jrochkind, to wrap
cronjobs and send output as email, including special subject
line for failed. 

At time of this writing, it's source is kept at
http://svn.mse.jhu.edu/repos/public/systems/trunk/unixutils/bin , 
but here it's just a copy-and-pasted separate copy in local source,
sorry. 

it's in Catalyst source, so we can have our Capistrano deploy
of cronjobs deploy cronjobs wrapped in cronmail. Particularly
our mass indexing job. Using 'whenever' gem to have capistrano
deploy cronjobs.

TODO: Update the documentation about Capistrano
