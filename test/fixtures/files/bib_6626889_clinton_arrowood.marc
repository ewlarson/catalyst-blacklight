He studied under Britton Johnson, then principal flutist for the Baltimore Symphony. Arrowood also attended the Vienna Academy of Music in Austria, Loyola College in Baltimore, Georgia State University, and Dartmouth College. Best known for his pen and ink drawings of animals, Arrowood created a magical world of the arts, where alligators were musicians, frogs performed in the corps de ballet, and lambs sang arias from the greatest operas ever written. He designed creative programs and posters for concerts at the Peabody Institute and other venues. Widely known for illustrating Donald Elliott's books Alligators and Music, Frogs and the Ballet, and Lambs' Tales from Great Operas, Arrowood drew caricatures with humor and poignancy that encouraged readers to reconsider their impressions of the performing arts. He also illustrated Witch, Witch!, edited in 1975 by Richard Shaw, and Young Brer Rabbit, written with Jacqueline Weiss in 1985. In addition to his performing and illustrating, for 21 years he taught art history, music appreciation, and flute at Garrison Forest School in Owings Mills, Maryland. He also taught for a year in the American School outside Turin, Italy. (Adapted from Ellen Gaines, "Clinton Arrowood," http://ellengaines.com/clinton-arrowood/.
